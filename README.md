# JavaScript-Basics
A wise man (I am lucky enough to call my dad) once told me:

- **"The best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. If you can't teach it to someone else, then you don't really know it yet."**

In the spirit of this idea, my goal with this repository is to provide commented code examples of the principles of JavaScript. As I learn and practice new concepts in [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), I will add them here. Eventually, It will include a web interface for navigating and viewing the repo contents.

-----------------

Hopefully at somepoint in the future, this will be a referencable learning/refreshing tool.
